# Simon Game
A variation of the classic Simon Game, implemented in C on a DAQ module simulator

# How-to-Play
When the game starts, Simon (the DAQ module) will flash a sequence of LEDs. The player then presses the buttons corresponding to each LED in order. Upon successful completion, Simon will flash a new sequence after every round. The player wins by successfully repeating the sequence 3 times in a row.
